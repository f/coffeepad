CoffeePad is actually nothing more than putting some awesome pieces together.
It's built with (Koding)[https://koding.com]'s Framework uses
[CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) as editor and
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)'s browser compiler. It keeps everyting
in localStorage even in Chrome extension, means there is no server dependency.
Everything happens in your browser.
